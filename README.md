My username is jkmidyette, I created my first GitHub repository
My first GitHub repository is named "jkmidyette.github.io"
- In the GitHub Desktop, I clicked on the repository I just created.
It then asks if you want to clone it, I clicked "Clone",
then it brings you to a page to save it in your Drive, I put the folder in my "Web Pgm" folder.
